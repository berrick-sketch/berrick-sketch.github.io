My page includes one title which is the title I was given in the assignment sheet. If there is more than one title, that is because I do not know how to code.

I did not do multipage because 1) I do not know how, 2) Even if I did, it would probably take more time.

I included headings corresponding with the headings that I was supposed to make according to the assignment sheet.

I organized the content the way I did because I did not know how to design it any other way. I am not a coder and this class is super confusing. I also made certain design choices because I would have gotten points off the final project had I not made those design choices (i.e. headings). Overall, I am tired right now because it is past 2am and the AI ruined everything by replacing my work with a new document. To conclude, I am not putting more effort into this paragraph because I am tired. I did not put effort into my design choices, I am just trying to get this project done as quickly as possible. The phrase "design choices" implies there was deliberation involved. There was no deliberation, I just typed out the things I needed to type. My design choice was that the quickest and easiest method wins because I do not know how to code and have no idea what I am doing.
