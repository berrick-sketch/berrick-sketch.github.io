<h1></h1> AI 109 - Alexandra Berrick
This is a website for my AI 109 class.<br>

If you (miraculously) found this website on the corner of the internet, I am sorry that you have wasted your time.<br>

As of now, this website serves no function other than being a project for school. Part of the project requires me to make the website public. I am enrolled in AI 109 Enter the World of Artificial Intelligence: Computing Principles, Ethics, and Impact at The Catholic University of America. I am taking this course from 01/12/2026 through 05/09/2026. This is my first project for the course and I am very unfamiliar with coding.<p></p>

<h2></h2> About Me
I am, as of February 2026, in my second semester at The Catholic University of America. I have absolutely zero interest in coding (as of 2/26) but consider it an important life skill. I am enrolled in this class because my mom wanted me to take an AI class. I enjoy singing karaoke. I also enjoy having an intact ACL. I hope Dr. Kelley is laughing while reading this.<p></p>

<h2></h2> AI Usage
This assignment is slowly starting to make me hate AI. Basically I accidentally asked AI to make me a README file after I had already made one. I ended up copy and pasting an older version to fix this issue after the AI could not fix nor tell me how to fix the problem. The most I have used AI on this project, that I am aware of, is the AI summarizer on Brave browser telling me that I can make headings with hash marks.<p></p>
