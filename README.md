## AI Usage
This assignment is slowly starting to make me hate AI. Basically I accidentally asked AI to make me a README file after I had already made one. I ended up copy and pasting an older version to fix this issue after the AI could not fix nor tell me how to fix the problem. The most I have used AI on this project, that I am aware of, is the AI summarizer on Brave browser telling me that I can make headings with hash marks.
