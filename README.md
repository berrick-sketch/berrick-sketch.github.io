# AI 109 - Alexandra Berrick
This is a website for my AI 109 class.

If you (miraculously) found this website on the corner of the internet, I am sorry that you have wasted your time.

As of now, this website serves no function other than being a project for school. Part of the project requires me to make the website public. I am enrolled in AI 109 Enter the World of Artificial Intelligence: Computing Principles, Ethics, and Impact at The Catholic University of America. I am taking this course from 01/12/2026 through 05/09/2026. This is my first project for the course and I am very unfamiliar with coding.

## About Me
I am, as of February 2026, in my second semester at The Catholic University of America. I have absolutely zero interest in coding (as of now) but consider it an important life skill. I am enrolled in this class because my mom wanted me to take an AI class. I enjoy singing karaoke. I also enjoy having an entact ACL. I hope Dr. Kelley is laughing while reading this.
