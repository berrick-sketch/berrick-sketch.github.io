# AI 109 - Alexandra Berrick
This is a website for my AI 109 class.

If you (miraculously) found this website on the corner of the internet, I am sorry that you have wasted your time.

As of now, this website serves no function other than being a project for school. Part of the project requires me to make the website public. I am enrolled in AI 109 Enter the World of Artificial Intelligence: Computing Principles, Ethics, and Impact at The Catholic University of America. I am taking this course from 01/12/2026 through 05/09/2026. This is my first project for the course and I am very unfamiliar with coding.
